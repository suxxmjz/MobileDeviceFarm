## Reddit scrapping

To see ads related to targeting, subscribe to list of subreddits that teenagers are more likely to visit.

## List of subreddits to subscribe to

The subreddits that you have in your home feed will determine which type of ads you will see.

Reddit advertisers generally promote curated content to specific subreddits. When browsing the app, you will see paid content with a tag such as `promoted`.

We can use that to our advantage, by subscribing to subreddits which we think will be visited by our target demographic.

Using a subreddit overlap [website](https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/teenagers), we can get a list of similarly visited subreddits.
